# Cosmos-Clicker
A clicker game made to explore the depths of space and beyond!

The idea was given to me when I didn't know what project to start.
Then, after one of my peers played cookie clicker and really enjoyed
the game, he suggested the team should create a clicker game. I was
immediately on board. Then, after months of careful consideration,
Cosmos Clicker was born!
